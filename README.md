### Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

After following the previous steps [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [Installation](#installation). Lets ensemble everything to be able to compile and make ODIN run.

#### Backend <a name="backend-configuration"></a>

1. Open in IntelliJ the [`ODIN/api`](api) folder.

2. Ensure that the other Nextia projects are updated and in the same folder of ODIN.

3. From IntelliJ open the [`build.gradle`](api/build.gradle) file.

4. Execute the task (by clicking the button `‚ñ∂` next to the task name) [`generateAndImportExternalJar`](https://github.com/dtim-upc/ODIN/blob/6ef41b22c57a7f763a91a7d0ae843918d0be1666/api/build.gradle#L174)

5. This task will generate the JAR folders of the Nextia projects and import them in ODIN.

6. Refresh the gradle to index the new JARs imported. Click the `üîÑ` button of gradle (normally on the right side of the editor).

7. Verify that the JAR libraries have been successfully imported into the lib directory in `ODIN/api` and properly indexed. If indexed correctly, you should be able to expand each JAR folder to inspect its contents.

8. Finally, open the project in IntelliJ IDE and execute the main class OdinApplication.java to launch the application.

_Note: The Nextia projects include `uberJar` tasks that generate a zipped folder containing compiled and optimized JAR files essential for seamless integration of Nextia functionalities within the ODIN system. The generated JARs can be found in the `build/libs` path of each respective project._
_If any JAR is not imported, you can generate it in the specific project using the `uberJar` task. However, exercise caution when propagating it to other dependent projects, as it may necessitate regenerating JARs in those projects as well._

_Also, please be aware that NextiaQR is currently an optional component._

#### Frontend <a name="frontend-configuration"></a>

1. Open in the terminal the `ODIN/frontend` folder.

2. Execute `npm install`.

3. Then, execute `yarn install`.

4. Finally, execute `quasar dev`. This will open your browser with the URL http://localhost:9000/#/projects.

_Note: that you must have Quasar CLI as it's mentioned in the Prerequisites section. If there's an error like `Global Quasar CLI ‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è   Error  Unknown command "dev"`, it's because you are not in the correct path, or you don't have Quasar CLI installed._ 


## Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>

   The project structure is primarily divided into two code sections (backend and frontend) and a third section for documentation, where the UML diagram is located. To access the UML diagram, VisualParadigm is required.

   The code sections consist of two IntelliJ projects. Please note that access to IntelliJ Ultimate is available with a UPC email account.

### Backend <a name="backend"></a>

   ODIN's backend is developed in **Java** and utilizes the **Spring framework**. As the backend for ODIN, its primary role is to **orchestrate** calls to various Nextia libraries within the department. **Each Nextia** library serves a distinct **functionality**, and ODIN also manages application persistence.

   ODIN's **persistence** is bifurcated into two components: graph persistence, currently using Jena, and relational database persistence using ORM with the embedded H2 database.

   Among the "external" Nextia libraries (those requiring JAR import), the following are noteworthy:

   - **NextiaCore:** Contains domain class definitions for the system and serves as a cross-cutting library. It lacks business logic, focusing solely on Plain Old Java Object (POJO) classes. 

   - **NextiaDataLayer:** Manages an intermediate persistence layer for accessing data from uploaded datasets.

   - **NextiaBS:** Extracts schemas from datasets loaded into ODIN and generates wrappers, which are SQL queries demonstrating how to access the original dataset's data.

   - **NextiaJD:** Join discovery. Responsible for automatically discovering attribute alignments from datasets.

   - **NextiaDI:** Handles data integration. Given two schemas and alignments, it integrates them and generates the corresponding integrated graph.

   Internally within ODIN, there are NextiaStore and NextiaGraphy. The former manages persistence, while the latter generates a string representation for visually rendering graphs generated by NextiaBS in the frontend.

   The diagram described above would look like this:

```mermaid

#### Summary modules structure
#### Transversal Modules

- **NextiaCore:** Contains domain class definitions and acts as a cross-cutting library.
- **NextiaDataLayer:** Manages an intermediate persistence layer to access data from loaded datasets.

#### Nextia Modules

- **NextiaBS:** Extracts schemas from loaded datasets in ODIN and generates wrappers.
- **NextiaJD:** Join discovery. Automatically discovers attribute alignments.
- **NextiaDI:** Handles data integration. Integrates two schemas and generates the corresponding integrated graph.
- **NextiaQR:** (Optional) Performs query-based searches on datasets.

#### Internal NextiaStore and NextiaGraphy

- **NextiaStore:** Manages persistence.
- **NextiaGraphy:** Generates a string representation for rendering graphs in the frontend.



#### Database Division <a name="database-division"></a>

NextiaStore is divided into two types of databases:

1. **Relational Database (H2):**
    - This is used to store relational data as could be some part of a project, datasets, user information...
    - If you must change something, make the necessary changes in the [orm.xml](api/src/main/resources/META-INF/orm.xml) in the `api/src/main/resources/META-INF/orm.xml` path. This file contains the mapping one-to-one with our domain objects persisted ([ORM syntax](https://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_5_1/jpa/metadata_xml.html)).

2. **Graph Database (Jena):**
    - This one is used to store the schemas of our graphs. This graphs now are implemented under an interface as Model Jena's object.

A usage example of the two databases are available in [getProjectById(String projectId)](https://github.com/dtim-upc/ODIN/blob/6ef41b22c57a7f763a91a7d0ae843918d0be1666/api/src/main/java/edu/upc/essi/dtim/odin/project/ProjectService.java#L167) or also [saveProject(Project project)](https://github.com/dtim-upc/ODIN/blob/6ef41b22c57a7f763a91a7d0ae843918d0be1666/api/src/main/java/edu/upc/essi/dtim/odin/project/ProjectService.java#L113) where we must get from the RelationalDB some information and the other related with its schemas from the GraphDB.

Both types are structured by the same pattern (see [NextiaStore](https://github.com/dtim-upc/ODIN/tree/main/api/src/main/java/edu/upc/essi/dtim/odin/NextiaStore) folder): Factory, Interface, Implementation. See the examples to know how to use them.

#### UML Diagram <a name="uml-diagram"></a>

The UML diagram provides an overview of the project structure. The key sections are described below:

#### Architecture <a name="backend-architecture"></a>

To see the UML class diagram, download [Visual Paradigm Community Edition](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp). It will ask you an email by the end of the installation or the first time you open the program just to send you the key activation code.

Then open the [UML conceptual ODIN.vpp](https://github.com/dtim-upc/ODIN/blob/integration-dataset-bug/doc/Diagrama%20UML/UML%20conceptual%20ODIN.vpp)

It should look like this:

#### Code Style <a name="code-style"></a>

##### Overview
This project follows a set of coding standards and practices to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. Adhering to these guidelines will help streamline collaboration and make the codebase more accessible to developers.

##### Branching Strategy
We follow a feature-based branching strategy, where each new feature or task is developed on a dedicated branch. Once a feature is complete and tested, it is merged into the main branch. Branches should be named descriptively, reflecting the nature of the feature or task they represent.

Example git graph:
```mermaid
gitGraph:
commit "Ashish"
branch newbranch
checkout newbranch
commit id:"1111"
commit tag:"test"
checkout main
commit type: HIGHLIGHT
commit
merge newbranch
commit
branch b2
commit
```

After a successful merge, the feature branch should be deleted to keep the repository clean and avoid unnecessary noise.

##### Code Organization
###### Main Branch
The main branch must always contain a working version of the project. Developers should avoid pushing directly to the main branch and instead use feature branches for development.

###### Naming Conventions
* CamelCase: Variable and method names should use CamelCase. For example: myVariable, calculateTotalAmount().

* Class Naming:
  * Interfaces: Named as ConcreteNameInterface.java (e.g., GraphStoreInterface.java).
  * Implementations: Named as ConcreteNameTechnologyUsedImpl (e.g., GraphStoreJenaImpl.java).
  Controller and Service Naming: Controllers should be named with a descriptive term followed by "Controller" (e.g., IntegrationController). The corresponding service should be named with a similar descriptive term followed by "Service" (e.g., IntegrationService).

* Communication between Components: Controllers only communicate with their associated services. Services can interact with other services but should not communicate directly with controllers. Interfaces are used for communication with other modules.

###### Dependency Management
* Interfaces for Communication: Use interfaces to define contracts for communication between modules. This enhances modularity and allows for easier maintenance and testing.
